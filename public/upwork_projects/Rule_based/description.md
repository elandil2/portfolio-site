# Customer Segmentation & Revenue Prediction System

## üéØ Project Overview

A comprehensive **customer analytics platform** built for a gaming company to predict customer lifetime value and optimize marketing strategies through advanced segmentation and machine learning.

## üíº Business Problem Solved

**Based_Rules Company** needed to understand their gaming customers better and predict revenue potential from new users. The challenge was creating actionable customer personas from demographic data and transaction history to make data-driven business decisions.

## üöÄ Key Features & Technologies

### **Dual Prediction Engine**
- **Rule-Based System**: Fast, interpretable customer segmentation using demographic profiles
- **Machine Learning Models**: Advanced algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost) for higher accuracy

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python** - Core development
- **Pandas, NumPy** - Data manipulation & analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - ML framework
- **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost** - Advanced ML algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment

### **Data Science Pipeline**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - 10+ professional visualizations
2. **Customer Persona Creation** - Level-based segmentation (COUNTRY_SOURCE_SEX_AGE)
3. **Revenue Prediction** - Both rule-based and ML approaches
4. **Model Evaluation** - Cross-validation and performance comparison

## üìä Results & Impact

### **Data Insights**
- Analyzed **5,000+ transactions** from **6 countries**
- Created **100+ unique customer personas**
- Identified **3 revenue segments** (A/B/C) with different value propositions

### **Business Value**
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Predict customer lifetime value for new acquisitions
- **Marketing Optimization**: Target high-value segments effectively
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus customer support on profitable demographics
- **Strategic Planning**: Data-driven expansion decisions

### **Technical Achievements**
- **Rule-Based Accuracy**: Instant predictions with clear business logic
- **ML Performance**: Advanced ensemble models with cross-validation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Production-ready prediction pipeline
- **Professional Visualizations**: Comprehensive EDA with actionable insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Deliverables

- **Complete Python Implementation** - Jupyter notebook ready
- **Interactive Web Dashboard** - HTML presentation with charts
- **Professional Documentation** - README and setup guides
- **Model Comparison Reports** - Performance analysis of all algorithms
- **Business Insights** - Actionable recommendations for stakeholders

## üí° Why This Project Stands Out

### **Real-World Application**
