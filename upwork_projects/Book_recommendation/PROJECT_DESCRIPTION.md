# 📚 Book Recommendation System

## Project Overview

A data-driven book recommendation system that helps users discover similar books based on their reading preferences. Built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques on a dataset of 271,000 books and 1.1 million user ratings.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

**Primary Objective:** Build a recommendation engine that suggests relevant books to users based on similarity patterns in user behavior and book metadata.

**Target Users:** Book enthusiasts, online bookstores, digital libraries, and reading platforms looking to enhance user engagement and discovery.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset)

**Dataset Statistics:**
- **Books:** 271,360 books with metadata (title, author, publisher, ISBN)
- **Ratings:** 1,149,780 user ratings (scale: 0-10)
- **Users:** 278,858 registered users
- **Time Period:** Books published from 1806 to 2024

**Data Quality:**
- Cleaned invalid publication years
- Removed duplicate entries
- Filtered out books with insufficient ratings (<20 ratings)
- Filtered out users with minimal activity (<50 ratings for collaborative filtering)

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. **Collaborative Filtering (Item-Based)**

**Technique:** Cosine Similarity on User-Item Matrix

**How It Works:**
- Creates a pivot table with books as rows and users as columns
- Values represent user ratings for each book
- Calculates cosine similarity between book rating vectors
- Recommends books with highest similarity scores

**Implementation:**
```python
- Filter active users (50+ ratings)
- Filter popular books (20+ ratings)
- Build user-item rating matrix
- Apply cosine similarity
- Return top N similar books
```

**Advantages:**
- Captures implicit patterns in user behavior
- Discovers books liked by users with similar tastes
- Works well for popular books with many ratings

**Use Case:** "Users who liked Book A also liked Books B, C, D..."

---

### 2. **Content-Based Filtering**

**Technique:** Text Vectorization + Cosine Similarity on Metadata

**How It Works:**
- Combines book metadata (author, publisher) into feature text
- Uses CountVectorizer to convert text to numerical vectors
- Calculates cosine similarity between feature vectors
- Recommends books with similar metadata profiles

**Implementation:**
```python
- Create combined features (author + publisher)
- Apply CountVectorizer with stop words removal
- Calculate cosine similarity matrix
- Return top N similar books
```

**Advantages:**
- Works for books with limited rating data (cold-start problem)
- Recommends books by same author or publisher
- Based on interpretable features

**Use Case:** "If you like this author/publisher, you might enjoy..."

## 🔍 Algorithm Comparison

| Aspect | Collaborative Filtering | Content-Based Filtering |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Data Required** | User ratings (behavior) | Book metadata (features) |
| **Cold Start Problem** | ❌ Struggles with new books | ✅ Works with new books |
| **Diversity** | ✅ Diverse recommendations | ⚠️ Limited to similar metadata |
| **Explanation** | ⚠️ "Users also liked..." | ✅ "Same author/publisher" |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Matrix grows with users | ✅ Only depends on item features |
| **Best For** | Popular books | New/niche books |

## 🚀 Technical Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Load Data**
   - Read CSV files with proper encoding (latin-1)
   - Handle large datasets with low_memory=False

2. **Clean Data**
   - Remove books with invalid years (e.g., 0, 1376, 2050)
   - Drop null values in critical columns
   - Remove duplicates based on ISBN and User-ID combinations

3. **Filter Data**
   - **Collaborative Filtering:**
     - Users with 50+ ratings
     - Books with 20+ ratings
   - **Content-Based Filtering:**
     - Books with 10+ ratings
     - Valid author/publisher metadata

4. **Build Features**
   - **Collaborative:** User-item rating matrix (sparse matrix)
   - **Content-Based:** Combined text features (author + publisher)

### Similarity Calculation:

**Cosine Similarity Formula:**
```
similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)

Where:
- A · B = dot product of vectors A and B
- ||A|| = magnitude of vector A
- ||B|| = magnitude of vector B
- Result ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical)
```

**Why Cosine Similarity?**
- Measures orientation, not magnitude
- Works well with sparse matrices
- Scale-invariant (handles different rating scales)
- Computationally efficient

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

### Running the Application:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the web app
streamlit run app.py
```

### Testing Recommendations:
- Try popular books: "Harry Potter", "The Da Vinci Code", "1984"
- Compare both algorithms to see different results
- Books with more ratings give better collaborative results

### Troubleshooting:
- If no recommendations found, try a more popular book
- Content-based works better for books with clear author/publisher
- Collaborative filtering needs books with 20+ ratings
